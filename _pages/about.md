 I'm currently an Associate Flight Physics Engineer at <a href="https://www.airbus.com/en">Airbus, India</a> where I work on the development of the new aerodynamic model for aircraft performance calculations to be used for the design of future aircrafts.

 I completed my Bachelor's in Engineering from Jadavpur University in [Mechnanical Engineering](https://jadavpuruniversity.in/academics/mechanical-engineering/) in 2019. To further learn about thermofluids, I pursued a Masters in Science (by Research) degree in the department of Mechnanical Engineering in [Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur](https://www.iitkgp.ac.in/) under the supervision of Prof. [Prasanta Kumar Das](https://www.iitkgp.ac.in/department/ME/faculty/me-pkd) in Heat Trasfer, Complex Fluids and Multiphase Flow Laboratory. 

 I'm fascinated by machines and the different machineries of nature, following a passion driven path of continuous learning. Physics is the bread and butter for my soul. 
          
 An 'engineer' by qualification, but I'm still in the process of learning and exploring engineering and eager to do some real hands on engineering using first principles to create exciting and meaningful machines. I'm highly motivated to contribute to fundamental research in the areas of Thermodynamics, Combustion, Aerodynamics, Propulsion, Turbulence, High Speed Flows and Astrophysics.
          

<!-- I am currently a research scholar in the Department of [Computer Science and Engineering](http://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/) at IIT Kharagpur, West Bengal. I am pursuing my Ph.D. under the supervision of Prof. [Sandip Chakraborty](https://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~sandipc/). I am also a member of the research group [Ubiquitous Networked Systems Lab (UbiNet)](https://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/resgrp/ubinet/). 

 Moreover, as a Visiting Postgraduate Research Student at the esteemed School of Computing and Information Systems at Singapore Management University ([SMU](https://www.smu.edu.sg/)), I am engaged in research work within the dynamic domain of the Human-Machine Collaborative Systems LAB, collaborating closely with [Prof. Archan Misra](https://sites.google.com/view/archan-misra) and [Prof. Thivya Kandappu](https://faculty.smu.edu.sg/profile/thivya-kandappu-541). 

My research interests include the areas of Millimeter Wave Sensing, FMCW Radars, HCI, Next generation cellular networks, Embedded systems, IoT, UAV, etc.-->

Projects 
======

- *Analysis of Single Bubble Rising Near a Vertical Wall in Still Liquid using OpenFOAM (MS Thesis) [Sept 2021 - Apr 2023]*
  • 3D VOF simulations for a 1mm air bubble rising near a vertical wall in still water for a range of bubble wall distances and Eo numbers
  • CFD Workflow in PARAM Shakti HPC cluster of IIT Kharagpur, grid independence study and validation of the case setup with literature
  • The maximum wall distance and the critical Eo number for the bubble to follow a bouncing trajectory was identified
  • The characteristics of the bouncing motion are independent of the initial wall distance, but they vary linearly with surface tension.
  • This work was accepted for publication in Open Access SCI Indexed journal

- *Design, Analysis and Performance Enhancement of Rocket Engines [Jun 2022 - Nov 2022]*
  • Calculated the overall sizing of the thrust chamber and nozzle dimensions for a 10 kN LOX-LNG Cryogenic Rocket Engine.
  • Used the NASA CEA Tool to find the optimum mixture ratio, specific impulse, propellant mass flow rate and other parameters.
  • Proposed fractal geometries for grain design of solid rocket motors and analysed their performance using OpenMotor.
  • The new grain design had a significant high initial thrust and also reduced the sliver by 41.4 % compared to the standard designs
  • The research on the new grain designs was accepted for publication in Heat Transfer Engineering

- *Experimental and Numerical Study of Turbulent Air Flow Through a Sudden Expansion Pipe [Jul 2018 - Sep 2019]*
  • Experimentally measured the velocity profile using a pitot tube probe both upstream and downstream of the sudden expansion region
  • Experiments were carried out for axisymmetric case and asymmetric case by placing baffles in the flow field
  • 2D simulations were performed using ANSYS Fluent to compare with the experiments and analyse the flow field details
  • Accepted for oral presentation at IHMTC-2019 held at IIT Roorkee, India

- *Thermoecological Analysis and Optimization of a Reversed Brayton Cycle Heat Pump [Jun 2018 - Jun 2019]*
  • Made a thermodynamic model for an Irreversible Reversed Brayton Cycle Heat Pump considering various irreversibilities in the system
  • Developed MATLAB code for calculation and optimization of important thermodynamic parameters.
  • Published in Advances in Mechanical Engineering: The selected Proceedings of ICRIDME 2018
  • Accepted for oral presentation at IHMTC-2019 held at IIT Roorkee, India
