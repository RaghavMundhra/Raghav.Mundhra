Work experience
======
* <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;  margin-top: 1em;"><strong>Associate Engineer - Flight Physics, Airbus India</strong> <span style="float: right; ">July 2023 - Present</span></p> 
  * Aircraft Performance Modeling, RnT Team:
    • Involved in the development of the new aerodynamic model for aircraft performance to be used for the design of future aircrafts
    • Grasped the aero data modeling philosophy for aircraft performance and analysed the performance for the take-off and climb phase
    • Generated trim point data using in-house tools to analyse the effect of the various conditions on aircraft performance for A321 XLR
    • Worked on a Python data analysis pipeline to model the trimmed aero data for aerial and ground phase performance calculations
    • Demonstrated the accuracy of the model for the climb phases and figured out the inadequacies in the model for take off phases
    • Supporting the model development for performance calculations for eAction
  * Aircraft Performance Data Production Focal
  * Analysis of Aircraft Inservice Data to Improve the Performance in Icing Conditions

* <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;  margin-top: 1em;"><strong>Project Assistant at Department of Mechanical Engineering, IIT Kharagpur (DST Funded Indo-Russian Project) </strong><span style="float: right; "> Aug 2019 - Aug 2021</span></p> 
  * The study of flow, turbulence and heat transfer enhancement in a near wall bubbly flow.
  * High Speed Photography (≈ 1000 fps) of the trajectory of air bubbles and kerosene droplets rising near inclined walls in still water.
  * Led the design of experiments, setup fabrication, created an Image Processing workflow in imageJ and MATLAB for flow analysis.
  * Obtained a regime map (for different wall inclination: 45° - 120° and bubble wall distance) of the different observed trajectories.
  * The transition angles for the change in bubble behavior was also extrapolated from the experimental dataset.
  * The work was accepted for Oral Presentation in APS DFD 2022.


* <p style="margin-bottom: 1em;  margin-top: 1em;"><strong>NIUS Physics Scholar at Homi Bhabha Centre for Science Education (HBCSE), TIFR</strong><span style="float: right; ">  June 
  2016 - July 2016 </span></p> 
  * Designed and developed three IoT prototypes for Sports Authority of India. (Starting Block,
Force Plate, Timing Gates)
